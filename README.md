Recently I find this book "Beginning iOS 8 Programming with Swift" is awsome. While learning by doing, I am going to commit my codes into this repository. At the same time, my "Contributions" to this repository can encourage me to keep moving.

**Let's get my feet wet with iOS and Swift! It's all about having fun with "hello swift"!**
